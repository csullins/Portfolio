# My Portfolio 

## First Iteration

Welcome to my portfolio! The code in this project contains the HTML and CSS for the very first design iteration of what will soon become a much more dynamic and complete portfolio.

## Usage 

The portfolio can be opened in any browser and includes features such as:
- a navigation menu with menu items that when click take you to scroll-section where the content is displayed on the page
- a section with my first three projects as a developer with links to each deployed application
- a fun bonus section which includes links to games which have both helped me understand css concept as well as have fun playing
- a contact section with my name, photo, and brief about me, my work and a placeholder form to contact me with (JavaScript coming soon!)

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
