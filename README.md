# My Portfolio 

## First Iteration

Welcome to my portfolio! The code in this project contains the HTML and CSS for the very first design iteration of what will soon become a much more dynamic and complete portfolio.

## Usage 

The portfolio can be opened in any browser and includes features such as:
- a navigation menu with menu items that when click take you to scroll-section where the content is displayed on the page
- a section with my first three projects as a developer with links to each deployed application
- a fun bonus section which includes links to games which have both helped me understand css concepts, and were fun to play
- a contact section with details about my work and a placeholder form to contact me with (JavaScript coming soon!)


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
